# Memories
This repository contains implementation of RAM, ROM, and, FIFO using verilog  

Implemented single port RAM(Random Access Memory) as well as Dual Port RAM and simulated them by creating separate testbench files for each.  

Similary, implemented ROM(Read Only Memory) and FIFO(First In First Out) and simulated them by creating testbench files.  

Also added the Simulation Waveforms and Netlists.
